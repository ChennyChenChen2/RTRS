			<itunes:summary>Spike is having second thoughts about running it back completely, so we discuss the possible problems with doing that. We also discuss the Sixers interviewing Avery Johnson to be an assistant coach, the team’s change atop their medical staff, and figure out which non-playoff starter they would trade a Sixers starter for if they had the chance. We also announced that the Final Lottery Party raised over $16,000 for the Providence Animal Center and Coded By Kids. Thank you!</itunes:summary>

We look back at Burnergate one year later, talk about its lasting effects, every crazy detail we can remember, rank the burner accounts, and go over Colagelo’s Sixers resume. We also go around the league with Ish Smith and discuss the Finals, the Timberwolves front office and the Rockets fire sale.

			<itunes:summary>The Sixers sneak by the Cavs lifelessly, but a win is a win, especially after a win. We announce the 2019 Lottery Party details (check them out here), and the fact that it will be the final lottery party. We need you there to give the proper goodbye to the era. We discuss the short-lived Jonah Bolden era, the brand new Zhaire Smith era, Joel Embiid’s return and new dog, and what, in fact, makes Brett Brown a good coach.

Lottery Party presale will be 3/20, sign up for the newsletter for the password.</itunes:summary>

We also take a look back at the context of Elton Brand’s 2008 Philly max and the reactions to it, as well as Brand’s playing career with Andrew Unterberger.</p>]]>

We discuss the greatness of Embiid, whether Simmons will make the team, and if the Sixers should be in on trying to trade for Kemba Walker or Rodney Hood. We also touch on the Markelle Fultz situation and the current struggles of Robert Covington. </itunes:summary>

The Lottery Party however is ON ON ON for XFINITY Live! on May 16th. **</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1487423994297_32727">If anyone was drunk on the success of the Sixers this year, the last two weeks have likely sobered you right up. We discuss the timeline and confusion of the Ben Simmons situation, the big Jahlil Okafor trade confusion, Bryan Colangelo's place in said confusion and Dario Saric's chances for Rookie Of The Year.</p><p>Our guest today is Derek "Godner" Bodner, the best Sixers beat writer in the city of Philadelphia. We get Derek's thoughts on the above situation and of course discussed his newest venture in which you can subscribe to Derek's writing.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1487423994297_35820">Derek is a fantastic writer and deserves your support. For just $3 a month, you get all of his writing, a daily Sixers email (which includes a mailbag question) and an excellent Sunday column. This, my friends, is how we escape the entire internet just being news aggregation, and create some actual news. You should do this. </p>]]>
